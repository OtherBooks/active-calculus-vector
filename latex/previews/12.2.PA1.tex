Recall from Section~\ref{S:9.3.Dot_Product} that the work done by a
force $\vF$ on an object that moves with displacement vector $\vv$ is
$\vF\cdot \vv$. In this Preview Activity, we will consider the work
done by a wind blowing due east at $45$ miles per hour on an airplane
at various stages of its journey.
\ba
\item A pilot flies for an hour and finds that he is $300$ miles from
  where he started at a heading of $20^\circ$ degrees east of due
  north. Find the work the wind has done on the airplane during the
  flight.
\item An hour later, the pilot determines that he is $275$ miles due
  north of where he previously checked his position. Find the work
  done by the wind on the airplane during the second hour of the
  flight.
\item Find the pilot's displacement from his original position after
  two hours of flying and use that to find the work done by the wind
  on the airplane during the first two hours of flight.
\item How does your answer to the previous part connect to the answers
  to the first two parts?
\item Suppose that the pilot then flies $45^\circ$ west of due north
  for $200$ miles. Find the work done by the wind on the airplane
  during this part of the journey.
