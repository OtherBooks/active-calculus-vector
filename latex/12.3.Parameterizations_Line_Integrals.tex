\subsection*{Introduction}

We begin this section by taking a look at how we might go about
calculating a line integral of a vector field along some line segments
and will use this as inspiration to see how treating oriented curves
as vector-valued functions can allow us to quickly turn a line
integral of a vector field into an integral of a single variable.

\subsection*{Parameterizations in the Definition of $\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr$}

Preview Activity~\ref{PA:12.3} has shown us that it is possible to
evaluate line integrals without needing to resort to working with
Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather
cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line
segments. Fortunately, parameterizing the oriented curve along which a
line integral is calculated provides a powerful tool for evaluating
line integrals.

Suppose that $C$ is an oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued
function $\vr(t)$ for $a\leq t\leq b$, and let $\vF$ be a continuous
vector field defined near $C$. We can divide the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$
subintervals, each of length $\Delta t = (b-a)/n$, by letting $t_i = a
+ i\Delta t$ for $i = 0,1,\dots,n$. This subdivision of $[a,b]$ then
can be used to break $C$ up into $n$ pieces by letting $\Delta \vr_i =
\vr(t_{i+1}) - \vr(t_{i})$ for $i=0,1,\dots,n-1$.  Now notice that
\[\Delta \vr_i = \vr(t_{i+1}) - \vr(t_{i}) = \vr(t_{i} + \Delta t) -
\vr(t_{i}) = \frac{\vr(t_{i} + \Delta t) -
\vr(t_{i})}{\Delta t}\Delta t.\]
Since the ratio in the last expression for $\Delta \vr_i$ is
approximately $\vr'(t_{i})$, we can say that $\Delta\vr_i\approx
\vr'(t_i)\Delta t$. Substituting this into the Reimann sum in the
definition of the line integral, we have
      \[\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \lim_{|\Delta\vr_i|\to 0}
      \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta\vr_i = \lim_{\Delta t\to
        0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \vF(\vr(t_i))\cdot \vr'(t_i)\Delta t.\]
This final Riemann sum is $\int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt$,
allowing us to reduce the evaluation of a line integral of a
vector-valued function along an oriented curve to an ordinary integral
of a function of one variable, since after evaluating the dot product,
$\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)$ is (scalar) function of $t$. We restate
this result below for easy reference.

      Let $C$ be a smooth, oriented curve traced out by the
      vector-valued function $\vr(t)$ for $a\leq t\leq b$ and let
      $\vF$ be a continuous vector field defined near $C$. Then
      \[\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt.\]
      
} \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

\begin{example}
  Let $\vF(x,y) = x\vi + y^2\vj$ and let $C$ be the quarter of the circle of
  radius $3$ from $(0,3)$ to $(3,0)$. This vector field and curve are
  shown in Figure~\ref{F:12.3.field-quarter-circle}. By properties of line integrals,
  we know that $\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = -\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr$, and
  we will use this property since $-C$ is the usual clockwise
  orientation of a circle, meaning we can parameterize $-C$ by $\vr(t)
  = \langle 3\cos(t),3\sin(t)\rangle$ for $0\leq t\leq \pi/2$.
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fig_12_3_field_quarter_circle.pdf}
    \caption{The vector field $\vF = x\vi + y^2\vj$ and an oriented
      curve $C$}
    \label{F:12.3.field-quarter-circle}
  \end{figure}

  To evaluate $\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr$ using this parameterization, we
  need to note that
  \[\vF(\vr(t)) = \langle 3\cos(t) , 9\sin^2(t)\rangle\qquad\text{and}
  \vr'(t) = \langle -3\sin(t),3\cos(t)\rangle.\]
  Thus, we have
  \begin{align*}\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr &= -\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr = -\int_0^{\pi/2}
  \langle 3\cos(t),9\sin^2(t)\rangle\cdot\langle
  -3\sin(t),3\cos(t)\rangle\, dt\\
    &= -\int_0^{\pi/2} \left(-9\sin(t)\cos(t) +
      27\sin^2(t)\cos(t)\right)\, dt\\
    & = -\int_0^1 (-9 u + 27u^2)\, du = -\left[ -\frac{9}{2}u^2 +
      9u^3\right]_0^1 = -\left(-\frac{9}{2} + 9\right) = -\frac{9}{2}.
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsection*{Alternative Notation for Line Integrals}

In contexts where the fact that the quantity we are measuring via a
line integral is best measured via a dot product (such as calculating
work), the notation we have used thus far for line integrals is fairly
common. However, sometimes the vector field is such that the units on
$x$, $y$, and $z$ are not distances. In this case, a dot product may
not have a physical meaning, and an alternative notation using
differentials can be common. Specifically, if $\vF(x,y,z) =
F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk$, then
\[\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy + F_3\, dz.\]
(If $\vF$ is a vector field in $\R^2$, the $F_3\, dz$ term is
omitted.) As a concrete example, if $\vF(x,y,z) = \langle
x^2y,z^3,x\cos(z)\rangle$ and $C$ is some oriented curve in $\R^3$,
then
\[\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_C x^2y\, dx + z^3\, dy + x\cos(z)\, dz.\]
It is important to recognize that the integral on the right-hand side
is still a line integral and must be evaluated using techniques for
evaluating line integrals. We cannot simply try to treat it as if it
were a definite integral of a function of one variable.

\subsection*{Independence of Parameterization}

Up to this point, we've just been choosing whatever parameterization
of an oriented curve $C$ came to mind, and our argument for how we can
use parameterizations to calculate line integrals did not depend on
the specific choice of parameterization. However, it is not
immediately obvious that different parameterizations don't result in
different values of the line integral. Our next example explores this question.

\begin{example}\label{ex:12.3.param-indep}
  Consider the vector field $\vF = x\vi$. Let us consider two
  different oriented curves from $(0,1)$ to $(3,3)$. The first
  oriented curve $C$ travels horizontally to $(3,1)$ and then proceeds
  vertically to $(3,3)$. The second oriented curve $C_3$ is the line
  segment from $(0,1)$ to $(3,3)$. Notice that, as depicted in
  Figure~\ref{F:12.3.x-field-triangle}, we can break $C$ up into two
  oriented curves $C_1$ (the horizontal portion) and $C_2$ (the
  vertical portion) so that $C = C_1 + C_2$.
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{overpic}[width=0.4\linewidth]{figures/fig_12_3_field_triangle.pdf}
      \put(80,48){$C_1$}
      \put(150,92){$C_2$}
      \put(80,115){$C_3$}
    \end{overpic}
    \caption{The vector field $\vF = x\vi$ and some oriented curves.     \label{F:12.3.x-field-triangle}}

  \end{figure}
  
  We first note that since $\vF$ is orthogonal to $C_2$,
  $\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr=0$; threfore $\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr =
  \int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr$. We can parameterize $C_1$ as just $x\vi+\vj$
  for $0\leq x\leq 3$, which leads to
  \[\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_0^3\langle x,0\rangle\cdot \langle
  1,0\rangle\, dx = \int_0^3 x\, dx = \frac{9}{2}.\]
  Thus, $\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 9/2$.

  Now we look at $\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr$, but we parameterize $C_3$
  in a bit of a nonstandard way by letting $\vr(t) = \langle
  3\sin(t),1+2\sin(t)\rangle$ for $0\leq t\leq \frac{\pi}{2}$. Then
  $\vr'(t) = \langle 3\cos(t),2\cos(t)\rangle$, and
  \[\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_0^{\pi/2}\langle
  3\sin(t),0\rangle\cdot\langle 3\cos(t),2\cos(t)\rangle\, dt =
  \int_0^{\pi/2} 9\sin(t)\cos(t)\, dt = \frac{9}{2}.\]
  In the next activity, you are asked to consider the more typical
  parameterization of $C_3$ and verify that using it gives the same
  value for the line integral.

  It's also worth observing here that $\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr =
  \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr$, so at least two (very different) paths
  from $(0,1)$ to $(3,3)$ give the same value of the line integral
  here. The next section will further investigate this phenomenon and
  when it happens.

\begin{summary}
\item If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are different paths from $P$ to $Q$, it is
  possible for $\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr$ to have a different value to
  $\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr$.
\item Line integrals of vector fields along oriented curves can be
  evaluated by parameterizing the curve in terms of $t$ and then
  calculating the integral of $\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)$ on the
  interval $[a,b]$.
\item The line integral $\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr$ can also be written as
  $\int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy$ if $\vF = \langle F_1,F_2\rangle$ is a
  vector field in $\R^2$ or $\int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy + F_3\, dz$ if
  $\vF = \langle F_1,F_2,F_3\rangle$ is a vector field in $\R^3$.
