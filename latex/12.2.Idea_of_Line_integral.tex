\subsection*{Introduction}

As we discussed in section \ref{S:12.1.VectorFields}, vector fields
are often useful as representations of forces such as gravity, wind,
and flowing water. We learned in section \ref{S:9.3.Dot_Product} that
the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us
how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail of
its displacement vector to the tip. However, things more complicated
when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force
is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves. For
example, how much work does a wind of $30$ mph toward the northwest do
on an airplane that's flying 500 miles due north? What if the wind
gets weaker the farther north the plane gets? In this
section, we begin investigating how integration can be used to
calculate the work a force field does in such circumstances.

\subsection*{Orientations of Curves}

Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does
on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern
ourselves with \emph{how} the object moves. In particular, in many
circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point
$(0,1)$ to the point $(4,3)$ by first going up the $y$-axis to $(0,3)$
and then moving horizontally to $(4,3)$ than if the object moves along
the line segment from $(0,1)$ directly to $(4,3)$. Similarly, given a
fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in
fact, opposite) if the object moves from $(4,3)$ to $(0,1)$ directly
along a line segment. We say that a curve in $\R^2$ or $\R^3$ is
\emph{oriented} if we have specified the direction of travel along the
curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a
vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation
follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.

\subsection*{Line Integrals}

Just as when we differentiated a vector-valued function $\vr(t)$ to
find a tangent vector, we begin by dividing a curve $C$ oriented from
a point $P$ to a point $Q$ into $n$ small, straight pieces. Each of
these pieces is in an area where the vector field $\vF$ is nearly
constant. In Figure~\ref{fig:12.2.curve-vectors}, we show this
situation. Each $\vr_i$ is the tip of a vector that traces out the
curve, and then the $\Delta\vr_i = \vr_{i+1}-\vr_i$ (shown in blue)
approximate the curve $C$. The green vectors are the vectors in the
vector field $\vF$ at each of the designated points along the curve.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/fig_12_2_curve_vec_field.pdf}
  \caption{A curve $C$ oriented from the point $P$ to the point
    $Q$. The tips of the vectors $\vr_i$ that trace out the curve are
    shown as points. The blue vectors are the $\Delta\vr_i$, while the
  green vectors are the vectors associated to each of the points by a
  vector field $\vF$.}
  \label{fig:12.2.curve-vectors}
\end{figure}

If we are trying to figure out how much a wind current helps or
hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then
calculating the dot product $\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i$ makes sense for
the local amount of help/hindrance, as if the vector $\vr_i$ along the
curve and the force field vector $\vF(\vr_i)$ point in similar
directions, the dot product will be positive.\footnote{We are abusing
  notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of $\vF$ is
  points in $\R^2$ or $\R^3$, and $\vr_i$ is a vector. By $\vF(\vr)$,
  we mean $\vF(r_1,r_2)$, where $\vr= \langle r_1,r_2\rangle$.} On the other hand, if
the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and
we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's
progress. Taking the sum over $i=0,\dots,n-1$, we have a Riemann sum
that approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft as
it flies along $C$:
\[\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta \vr_i.\]
This suggests the following definition.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} \label{def:12.2.line-integral}Let $C$ be an oriented curve and
      $\vF$ a vector field defined in a region containing $C$. The
      \textbf{line integral}\index{lineintegral!definition} of $\vF$
      along $C$ is
      \[\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \lim_{|\Delta\vr_i|\to 0}
      \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta\vr_i,\]
      provided the limit exists.
\end{definition} } \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

The limit in definition~\ref{def:12.2.line-integral} exists provided
that $\vF$ is a continuous vector field, by which we mean that each
component function of $\vF$ is continuous as a function of $2$ or $3$
variables, and that $C$ is a piecewise smooth curved traced out from
its initial point to its terminal point without retracing any portion
of the curve.

Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral
$\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr$ can each be viewed as the work done by $\vF$ as
an object moves along the (very small) vector $\Delta\vr$, the line
integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object
that moves along $C$ (in the direction of its orientation).

\input{activities/12.2.Act2}

The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to
calculate line integrals, since the limit in the definition, just like
the limit in the definition of every other type of integral we've
studied so far, is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in
the case where the oriented curve $C$ is composed of horizontal and
vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a
single-variable integral, as the following example shows.

\begin{example}\label{ex:12.2.line-int}
  Consider the constant vector field $\vF(x,y) = \langle
  2,1\rangle$. Let $C$ be the curve that follows the horizontal line
  segment from $(1,1)$ to $(4,1)$ and then continues down the vertical
  line segment to $(4,-2)$. Figure~\ref{fig:12.2.curve-field} shows
  $\vF$ and $C$, including the orientation.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/fig_12_2_field_line_segs.pdf}
  \caption{An oriented curve from $(1,1)$ to $(4,-2)$ in a vector
    field $\vF$.}
  \label{fig:12.2.curve-field}
\end{figure}

To calculate $\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr$, we'll start by working with the
horizontal line segment. Along that part of $C$, notice that
$d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta x\vi$. Thus, the Riemann sum that
calculates the line integral along this portion of $C$ consists of
terms of the form $\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
x$. Along this part of $C$, $x$ ranges from $1$ to $4$, and thus we
can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral $\int_1^4 2\,
dx = 6$. Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that
agrees with the orientation of $C$, we are not surprised to have a
positive value here.

Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of $C$. Here $d\vr
\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta y\vj$, which means that $\vF\cdot
d\vr\approx 1\Delta y$. Hence, our Riemann sum can
be calculated by the definite integral $\int_1^{-2} 1\, dy =
-3$. Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match
the orientation of $C$. Also, the negative value should not be
unexpected, since $C$ is oriented in a direction for which the vectors
of $\vF$ point in a direction that would hinder motion along $C$.

Combining these two pieces of work, we find that $\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr
= 6 - 3 = 3$.
\end{example}

\subsection*{Properties of Line Integrals}

In Example~\ref{ex:12.2.line-int}, we implicitly made use of the idea
that if $C$ can be broken up into two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that
the endpoint of $C_1$ is the start point of $C_2$, then the line
integral of $\vF$ along $C$ is the sum of the line integrals of $\vF$
along $C_1$ and along $C_2$. This probably seems natural, based on the
property for definite integrals which tells us that
\[\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = \int_a^c f(x)\, dx + \int_c^b f(x)\, dx.\]
The table below summarizes some other properties of line integrals,
each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of
definite integrals. If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are oriented curves, with $C_1$
from a point $P$ to a point $Q$ and $C_2$ from $Q$ to a point $R$, we
denote by $C_1+C_2$ the oriented curve from $P$ to $R$ that follows
$C_1$ to $Q$ and then continues along $C_2$ to $R$. Also, if $C$ is an
oriented curve, $-C$ denotes the same curve but with the opposite
orientation.

    For a constant scalar $k$, vector fields $\vF$ and $\vG$, and
    oriented curves $C$, $C_1$, and $C_2$, the following properties hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\ds\int_C (k\vF)\cdot d\vr = k\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr$
    \item $\ds\int_C(\vF+\vG)\cdot d\vr = \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr +

      \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr$.

\subsection*{The Circulation of a Vector Field}

If an oriented curve $C$ ends at the same point where it started, we
say that $C$ is \textbf{closed}. The line integral of a vector field
$\vF$ along a closed curve $C$ is called the \textbf{circulation} of
$\vF$ around $C$. To emphasize the fact that $C$ is closed, we
sometimes write $\oint_C \vF\cdot d\vr$ for $\int_C \vF\cdot
d\vr$. Circulation servies as a measure of a vector field's tendency
to rotate in a manner consistent with the orientation of the curve.

  curve into many small segments along which the vector field is
  essentially constant.
