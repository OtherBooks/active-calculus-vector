\subsection*{Introduction}

Thus far vectors have played a central role in our study of
multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors
(addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen
how vectors can be used to describe curves in $\R^2$ and $\R^3$. The
examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of
a vector-valued function. That is, a curve $\vr(t)$ is really a
function that takes as input a real number and produces a vector in
$\R^2$ or $\R^3$. In this section we will expand our understanding of
vector-valued functions to take as input a point $(x,y)$ in $\R^2$ or
a point $(x,y,z)$ in $\R^3$ and produce a vector (typically in $\R^2$
or $\R^3$, respectively).

\subsection*{Examples of Vector Fields}

As Preview Activity~\ref{PA:12.1} showed you, one example of a time
where it makes sense to associate a vector to each point in a region
is a \emph{velocity vector field} $\vF(x,y)$ or $\vF(x,y,z)$, where
the vector associated to the point $(x,y)$ or $(x,y,z)$ is the
velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but
another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid.
Figure~\ref{fig:12.1.fluid-velocity} shows such a velocity vector
field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector
field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors
were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner,
which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on
the red square of the main figure.

Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of
vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on
objects. The force is directed from the center of the object to the
center of the earth, and its magnitude is determined by the distance
between the object and the earth. An illustration of this vector field
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:12.1.gravity}, where the earth is
positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get
shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact
that the gravitational force is weaker at that distance.

\subsection*{Mathematical Vector Fields}

As suggested in the introduction and Preview Activity~\ref{PA:12.1},
vector fields can be given by formulas.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} A
      \textbf{vector field}\index{vectorfield!definition} in $2$-space
      function whose value at a point $(x,y)$ is a $2$-dimensional
      vector $\vF(x,y)$. In $3$-space, a vector field is similarly a
      function $\vF(x,y,z)$ whose value at the point $(x,y,z)$ is a
      $3$-dimensional vector.
\end{definition} } \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

Since $\vF(x,y,z)$ is a vector, it has $\vi$, $\vj$, and $\vk$
components. Each of these components is a scalar function of the point
$(x,y,z)$, and so we will often write
\[\vF(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk.\]
For example, if $\vF(x,y,z) = \langle x^2,xy\sin(z),y^3\rangle$, then
$F_1(x,y,z) = x^2$, $F_2(x,y,z) = xy\sin(z)$, and $F_3(x,y,z) =
y^3$. Any time we are considering a vector field $\vF(x,y,z)$, the
definitions of functions $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ should be assumed in
this manner. (For a vector field $\vF(x,y)$ in $2$-space, we only have
the functions $F_1$ and $F_2$, defined analogously.)

\subsection*{Plotting Vector Fields}

Preview Activity~\ref{PA:12.1} gave you a chance to plot some vectors
in the vector fields $\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle$ and $\vG(x,y) =
\langle 0,-x\rangle$. It would be impossible to sketch \emph{all} of
the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point
in the plane. In fact, even sketching by hand many more of the vectors
than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes
tedious. Fortunately, computer algebra systems can do a great job of
making such sketches. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the
magnitudes of the vectors are typically scaled in these plots,
including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in the
text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field
$\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj$ in Figure~\ref{fig:12.1.scale-field}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{figures/12_1_vecfield_unscaled.pdf}\hspace{0.2\linewidth}  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{figures/12_1_vecfield_scaled.pdf}
  \caption{Two plots of $\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj$ from a computer
    algebra system}
  \label{fig:12.1.scale-field}
\end{figure}
The left plot shows some of the vectors but accurately depicts all of
their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand,
especially along the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$. The plot on the right,
however, uses a uniform scaling to make the figure easier to read. As
before, each vector's direction is completely accurate, but now the
magnitudes are much smaller. However, the \emph{relative} magnitudes
are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin
have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.

\subsection*{Gradient Vector Fields}

Without using the terminology, we've actually already encountered one
very important family of vector fields a number of times. Given a function $f$ of two or three variables, the gradient of
$f$ is a vector field, since for any point where $f$ has first-order
partial derivatives, $\nabla f$ assigns a vector to that point.

\begin{summary}
\item A $2$-dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of
  $\R^2$ whose value is a $2$-dimensional vector. A $3$-dimensional
  vector field is a function defined on part of $\R^3$ whose value is
  a $3$-dimensional vector.
\item Vector fields arise in familiar contexts such as wind velocity,
  fluid velocity, and gravitational force.
\item Vector fields are generally plotted in ways that ensure the
  direction and relative magnitudes of the vectors sketched are
  correct instead of ensuring that each vector's magnitude is
  depicted correctly.
\item The gradient of a function $f$ of two or three variables is a vector
  field defined wherever $f$ has partial derivatives.
